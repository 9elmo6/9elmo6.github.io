# Portifolio 

## Eduction
### Masters Degree: 2022 - present 
Started my Masters Degree at Ontario Tech University in Electrical Engineering and Applied Science. I am a part of of the IoT research lab, where we work on some cool [projects](https://iotresearchlab.ca). 
Finished the following five courses:
1. Real-time data analysis:
  Studied the following topics:
  * Real-time data streaming/processing 
  * IoT architectures and working with data
  * Deep learning for IoT
  * Time series analysis and spatiotemporal modelling

> In the course project, I worked on enhancing YOLOv4 detection by adding an image enhancment techniques in a pipeline. This helpful for automnmous 
> vechiles in challenging weather conditions. A paper is done and pending relative confernce for publication.

2. Advanced software and data engineering

3. Data mining

>	Conducted a comprehensive sentiment analysis of the FIFA World Cup 2022 by collecting and examining tweets over a 12-year period (around 10M tweets) since the announcement of Qatar as the host in 2010, providing valuable insights into public perception and opinion trends.

4. Network computing
> Designed and implemented a predictive maintenance system for air production units using the MetroPT benchmark dataset. The system was deployed on Google Cloud, allowing for real-time data collection and analysis from connected sensors through the Pub/Sub messaging service. This streamlined solution enables more efficient maintenance and reduced downtime for the production units.

5. Sensors networks
> Worked on simulating WSN attacks using Cooja and Contiki-NG and implementing ways to overcome these attacks

### BENG Degree: 2018 - 2021 
Achieved a First class in a degree focused on Control Systems Analysis, Engineering Mathematics, Microcontrollers and Programmable Logic, Analogue Analysis and Design, Advanced Electronics Systems, Real-time Embedded Systems, Control Systems Design, and Digital Signal Processing.
Personal areas of growth:

1. Developed knowledge in C/C++ programming language, and applied this knowledge in different projects for example, a line follower robot, and a conveyor belt project.

2. My final year project was on smart homes and machine learning, where I built a system that collects and stores different types of data for example the house electric appliances power measurements, network presence information. Then uses a machine learning trained model to optimize the total energy usage of the house. Technical skills like Python, Linux, bash scripting, and machine learning were developed and applied in the project.

3. The main aim of the project is to ensure that user data stays private and secure during the whole process of collection, storing, and training the machine learning model, so opensource software was utilized to be able to meet this requirement like OpenHab, InfluxDB, Grafana, and MQTT protocol.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
