## Masters Courses

Started my Masters Degree at Ontario Tech University in Electrical Engineering and Applied Science. I am a part of of the IoT research lab, where we work on some cool [projects](https://iotresearchlab.ca). 
Finished the following five courses:
1. Real-time data analysis:
  Studied the following topics:
  * Real-time data streaming/processing 
  * IoT architectures and working with data
  * Deep learning for IoT
  * Time series analysis and spatiotemporal modelling

> In the course project, I worked on enhancing YOLOv4 detection by adding an image enhancment techniques in a pipeline. This helpful for automnmous 
> vechiles in challenging weather conditions. A paper is done and pending relative confernce for publication.

2. Advanced software and data engineering

3. Data mining

4. Network computing
> Designed and implemented a predictive maintenance system for air production units using the MetroPT benchmark dataset. The system was deployed on Google Cloud, allowing for real-time data collection and analysis from connected sensors through the Pub/Sub messaging service. This streamlined solution enables more efficient maintenance and reduced downtime for the production units. [project repo](https://github.com/9elmo6/ProActRail)

5. Sensors networks
> Worked on simulating WSN attacks using Cooja and Contiki-NG and implementing ways to overcome these attacks
